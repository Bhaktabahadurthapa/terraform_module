# terraform_module
A **"module" in Terraform** is a reusable block of configuration code that groups related infrastructure resources together, allowing you to easily manage complex infrastructure by breaking it down into smaller, logical units, promoting code reusability, consistency, and easier maintenance across different projects. 

`Key reasons to use modules in Terraform:`

**Organization:**
Modules help structure your Terraform configuration by keeping related resources together, making it easier to understand and navigate complex deployments. 
**Reusability:**
Once created, a module can be used multiple times within the same project or across different projects, saving time and effort by avoiding writing the same code repeatedly. 
**Consistency:**
By using modules, you ensure that similar infrastructure components are deployed with the same configuration across environments, minimizing errors. 
**Encapsulation:**
Modules encapsulate configuration details, preventing unintended changes to other parts of your infrastructure and improving overall code quality. 
**Scalability:**
When your infrastructure grows, modules allow you to easily add new components by simply calling the relevant module, simplifying management. 

**Example:**
Imagine you need to deploy a web server with a load balancer and a database. You can create a "webserver" module that includes the configurations for all three resources, then call that module within your main Terraform configuration whenever you need to deploy a new web application
